<h1>Athan Speaker</h1>

<h2><a href="https://jakeespinosa.github.io/athan-frontend/">Generate your API call string here!</a></h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Turn any bluetooth speaker into an <a href="https://studioarabiya.com/blog/muslim-world/what-does-athan-mean-in-islam">athan</a> speaker and enjoy the blessings of having the call to prayer played in your home! This project consists of 2 Python scripts, a React front-end to generate the API call string with ease, a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bilalahmadofcl/most-beautiful-azan-adhan-no-copyright-free-islamic-background">copyright-free athan .mp3 file</a>, and a silent .mp3 file to keep the speaker turned on.
